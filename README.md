# Minialphago_reversi
- Course project for CS21191890（**94**/100）<br>by <a href="https://github.com/KenGeng">@KenGeng</a> and <a href="https://github.com/FANG-Xiaolin">@FANG-Xiaolin</a>.<br>
- Minialphago_reversi with MCTS.<br><br>

The mainloop(Cpp) is in `Cpp` folder. <br>
Rollout policy(python) is in `python` folder <br>

The code is a little bit confusing if you run it directly. <br>
**Please do not borrow the code directly for course projects if your mentor does not allow you to do so.**
